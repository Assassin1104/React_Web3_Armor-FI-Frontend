There is a gap in the market for dynamic coverage across a wide range of protocols with an adjustable coverage value and expiration curve.",

  "About.Paragraph4": "Underwritten by Nexus, Armor evolves digital asset coverage from static chunks of coverage toward dynamic risk management customized to client demands and circumstances. Instead of sticking to a fixed amount, a set timeframe, and expiration date, all of these inputs can be dynamically recommended and modified at any time.",
